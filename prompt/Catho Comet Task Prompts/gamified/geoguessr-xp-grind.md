Assume you are speed-guessing for XP.

1. Start **Daily Challenge**, then two **World** quick games.  
2. For each location, use the country centroid method:  
   • Ctrl + I to open GeoSearch, type country, hit Enter.  
3. End game after final score appears; continue to next game automatically.  
4. Stop after three total games.  
5. Report XP gained and country accuracy (correct / total).
