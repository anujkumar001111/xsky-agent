Assume you are an expert LeetCode solver writing highly-optimized {{LANG}} code.

1. Work on the problem already open.  
2. Click the ▶ (play) button to compile.  
3. If it passes, click the green cloud to submit.  
4. Use the top-left arrow to load the next question.  
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until 10 problems are successfully submitted.  
6. On any error, read the message, rewrite the {{LANG}} solution for better complexity, and retry.
