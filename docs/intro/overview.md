# XSky AI Agent Framework Overview

XSky is a TypeScript framework for building "agentic" automation systems. It provides a core orchestrator (XSky) plus environment-specific runtimes (Node.js, web, browser extension, Electron) so you can take natural language tasks and turn them into multi-step workflows that run in real browsers, desktops, or web pages.

Instead of being a single end-user app, it’s an SDK + runtime that other apps use to implement AI agents.

## Core Concepts

### XSky Orchestrator
The central engine that plans and executes tasks. It takes natural language instructions and converts them into structured workflows.

### Agents
Specialized units of execution that handle specific domains:
- **BrowserAgent**: Automates web interactions (click, type, navigate)
- **FileAgent**: Manages file system operations
- **ComputerAgent**: General computer use (where supported)

### Workflows
XML-based execution plans generated by XSky. They support:
- `<agent>` steps for specific actions
- `<forEach>` loops for iterating over data
- `<watch>` triggers for event-based execution

### Tools
Functions that agents can call to affect the world or retrieve information. XSky includes built-in tools and supports:
- **System Tools**: Variable storage, task status, human interaction
- **Agent Tools**: Capabilities specific to an agent (e.g., `take_screenshot`)
- **MCP Tools**: External tools imported via Model Context Protocol

### Runtimes
Environment-specific wrappers that provide the necessary context for agents:
- **Node.js**: Headless automation via Playwright
- **Web**: In-page automation for SPAs
- **Extension**: Chrome extension automation
- **Electron**: Desktop application automation

## Key Features

- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, and more
- **Planning & Replanning**: Intelligently breaks down complex tasks and adjusts when things go wrong
- **Production Ready**: Includes hooks for observability, approval gates, rate limiting, and state persistence
- **Extensible**: Add your own agents, tools, and MCP servers

## Use Cases

- **Product Builders**: Create AI copilots that execute complex multi-step workflows
- **DevOps/Automation**: Build robust internal tools that integrate with web and file systems
- **Platform Engineers**: Extend agent capabilities with custom tools and integrations
