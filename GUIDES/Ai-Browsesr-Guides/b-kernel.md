## Common Browser Kernels

<!-- [Reference: Baidu Encyclopedia](<[https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8%E5%86%85%E6%A0%B8](https://baike.baidu.com/item/浏览器内核)>) -->

> The most important or core part of a browser is the "Rendering Engine", which can be roughly translated as "rendering engine", but we generally refer to it as the "browser kernel".

**Different browser kernels interpret the syntax of web page writing differently, so the same web page may have different rendering (display) effects in browsers with different kernels. This is why web developers need to test web page display effects in browsers with different kernels.**
